Run
-------
$ python main.py

Usage
-----
0. The current tool requires that **the images to be labeled reside in /Images/001, /Images/002, etc. You will need to modify the code if you want to label images elsewhere**.
1. Input a folder number (e.g, 1, 2, 5...), and click `Load`. The images in the folder, along with a few example results will be loaded.
2. To create a new bounding box, left-click to select the first vertex. Moving the mouse to draw a rectangle, and left-click again to select the second vertex.
  - To cancel the bounding box while drawing, just press `<Esc>`.
  - To delete a existing bounding box, select it from the listbox, and click `Delete`.
  - To delete all existing bounding boxes in the image, simply click `ClearAll`.
3. After finishing one image, click `Next` to advance. Likewise, click `Prev` to reverse. Or, input an image id and click `Go` to navigate to the speficied image.
  - Be sure to click `Next` after finishing a image, or the result won't be saved.
